## Overview
This is the backend for a location based app. A user inputs a location, and the app displays a map of that location. 

Note: create an .env.local file with your value for the variable `VITE_API_KEY=` to view.

## Getting Started


## Architecture
The app is designed to respond to the user's location input. 

The app utilizes React, Axios and LocationIQ.
